# Car-Price-Predictor-using-Linear-Regression
Data I have used is Quikr Car Data 
Before i start working on this, i have cleaned this data because

Data Quality Issue
names are pretty inconsistent
names have company names attached to it
some names are spam like 'Maruti Ertiga showroom condition with' and 'Well mentained Tata Sumo'
company: many of the names are not of any company like 'Used', 'URJENT', and so on.
year has many non-year values
year is in object. Change to integer
Price has Ask for Price
Price has commas in its prices and is in object
kms_driven has object values with kms at last.
It has nan values and two rows have 'Petrol' in them
fuel_type has nan values


Cleaing Data was More Important, I have make sure, all the independed variables are in the right Data type.

Also I have limitd the car name to first three Words.

Checking relationship between price & Independent variables
Company vs Price
Year vs Price
Kms Driven vs Price
Fuel Type vs Price

Realtionship of Price with Fuel Type, Year, Company
